# Pizza Time!

## by Stopped Clock Studios

**_Pizza Time!_** is a VR pizza-making extravaganza for the HTC Vive. Take orders, cover pizzas in sweet sweet ingredients, and don't look the robots in the eyes.

You'll have only a minute or two to make each pizza to order by throwing on toppings and tossing it in the oven â€” but not for too long or it'll burn! Complete as many pizzas as you can and see how much money you can make before you get three strikes by messing up orders. 

**Pizza Time! requires an HTC Vive to play.**
